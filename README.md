# Brain_7

DATA/PHYS3888 Group Brain_7's private GitHub repository to store code and data.

## Procedure

Use branches before submitting to the main branch so that everyone can see the changes before
they are merged.

### Week 6

#### Aim

- By week 10 have a simple programe working.
- Take sample code of quick consecutive blinks next week.

#### Action

- Took sample data for left, right and blink.
- Considered flappy bird but maybe too simple.
- Considered lane games like crazy taxi but may be too complicated.
- Considering creating a simpler version of space invaders:
    - Blink to shoot
    - Left and right to switch between three lanes
    - Simple black and white background

#### Friday Meeting Agenda

- Complete presentation
- Discuss space invaders idea

### Week 7

#### Action

- Took sample data of quick consecutive blinks
- Took sample data for different left, right and blink patterns to immitate movements in a game
- Try to read sample data with code
    - Read if there is an event
    - classify if it's left or right
    - classification of blink still working
    - 80% accuracy

#### Problem

- Classifier used is just if it crosses 0
    - We need training data
    - Possible KNN (nearest neighbour)
- 80% accuracy

#### Aim

- Left-right classifier
    - Data students
- Game developing
    - Pavadol
- Filtering
    - Elsa
